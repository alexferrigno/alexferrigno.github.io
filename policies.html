        	<p>
        		The <a href="http://ucllawsociety.co.uk">UCL Law Society</a> website is obviously brilliant as it is. The design is professional and it brings in a large proportion of our revenue for the Society. Thus, I do not propose any large design changes which would alter our image vastly for no extra gain.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		What I do propose are minor changes but ones which I think everyone would appreciate. 
        		<ul>
        			<li>
        				<p>I propose that the separate pages of the website actually be separated out into separate pages. I have not looked at the coding of the site yet but this should be a reasonably easy change of simply moving each of the separate sets of elements governing each page into their own .html files.</p>
        				
        				<p>This would have two major benefits. Firstly, it would enable the site to load much faster as it would only have to load the html for any given part of the website rather than for the entire site. Secondly, it would mean that when you are sitting there refreshing frantically for ball tickets next year you will stay on the socials page the whole time.
        			</li>
        			<li>
        				<p>
        					My other policy is just to continue the great job Tanya has done and continue to improve the site. There are a number of parts of the site which I will be able to make load faster (such as changing an image to a 'div' element here and there). These will all be minor changes but should make the site faster and more responsive overall.
        				</p>
        			</li>
        		</ul>
