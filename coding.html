            <p>
                I have only been coding for a few months now so admit that I have no heavy experience behind me which I can show you, or professional work done already under my belt. Up until now I have only coded small css and html experiments, and predominantly been learning and practising on <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.
                However, I feel that I have learnt a lot in these last few months and hope that this shows by my ability to put a website together in a few days while dealing with essays and other commitments too.</p>

                <p>I coded this in Sublime Text 2, then compiled it using Github and have hosted the site on Github Pages.
                I have used a broad spectrum of both HTML and CSS elements while designing this and would be happy to answer absolutely any and all questions on the way it was made both through facebook messages (link above) and in the Cissy Chu from 1-2pm.</p>
