        		Me
        	</h1>

        	<p> I've been learning some basic html coding for a little while now and feel very confident in my skillset. In order to demonstrate this to you I have made this small but functional website.</p>

			<p>
				I started learning to code because I am very interested in technology and software. I would eventually like to be able to code apps for iOS and in order to do that I would have to learn a far more complex programming language than either HTML or CSS. That is why I started learning those two, so that I could gain some experience and competence with programing languages in general. Since I started, I have enjoyed it and have been learning something new nearly every day. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I understand that the website is both a major source of income for the Society and the outward face of the Society to most of the world and our sponsors. This is clearly a lot of responsibility but I am more than happy to rise to the challenge. I will be on hand day or night to fix the website if anything ever goes wrong with it, and will be working to better it from the day it is transferred over to me during Summer. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				That is why I think I am the right candidate for Webmaster. I enjoy coding and of course care about the Society, and so can be relied upon to devote as much of my time as necessary to the very worthy cause of keeping the website running smoothly. I am also more than ready to take on the responsibility and will not treat it lightly, but with the importance it deserves. I will make sure that our sponsors, both current and potential, are impressed by our website and the way we look to the world. And by the time I take over from Tanya I will be even better and more proficient than I am now and so will be perfectly capable to be your new Webmaster and look after the site for us all.
