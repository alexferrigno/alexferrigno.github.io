        	<p> I've been learning some basic html coding for a little while now and feel fairly confident in my skillset. In order to demonstrate this to you I have made this small but functional website.</p>

			<p>
				I have been learning to code because I am very interested in technology and software. I would eventually like to be able to code apps for iOS and in order to do that I would have to learn a far more complex programming language than either HTML or CSS. That is why I started learning those two, so that I could gain some experience and competence with programing languages in general. Since I started, I have enjoyed it and have been learning something new nearly every day. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				That is why I think I am the right candidate for Webmaster. I am passionate and knowledgeable and by the time I take over from Tanya will be even more proficient than I am now and perfectly able to update and better the Society's website.
